The Golden Driller marathon includes a race distance for all levels from 5k to marathon!  All races will be held on the very nice paved trails of Tulsa's Riverparks system along the banks of the Arkansas River.  The race gets it's name from the iconic Golden Driller statue located at EXPO Square in Tulsa.

Each participant will receive a tech shirt with their entry, as well as a great custom finisher medal that features the Golden Driller.  This race is known for it's small size and friendly nature, as well as great post race food and beer for those 21 and over.  This is a great smaller marathon or half for those who want to avoid the crush of giant big city races.  

The course is flat and fast, with the exception of one hill that appears on the marathon course.  All other courses are flat.  On-site parking at the start/finish is available.
